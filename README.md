# Hoop'n - a pick-up game app
#### By Hamid Ebrahimi, David Cibin, Kentdrick Barnes, and Matt Packer  


*Hoop'n* is a full 'MERN' (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack application that makes full use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data operations.  

This application was designed to help give basketball enthusiasts easier access to pick-up games in their local area. Using the Google Maps Places API, the app allows users to use their geolocation to find pick-up games and parks in their area, and provides real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Users can also create their own events, and leave reviews for events they have participated in. This application was designed using a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive for use on mobile phones or PC/Mac web browsers. 

*Hoop'n* was created during the third unit of [General Assembly](https://www.generalassemb.ly)'s Software Engineering Immersive program. The initial version was planned, developed and deployed over the course of two weeks. It was created from scratch using technologies in the ‘MERN’ stack, including MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React and Node.

Future enhancements are planned and are outlined below.


### Getting Started:
The app can be launched [here](https://ball-n.herokuapp.com/) and was deployed using Heroku.

We used Trello to oranize our project throughout development. Our Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/Ob8kwzWp/unit-3-full-stack-mern-app-hoopn#).
